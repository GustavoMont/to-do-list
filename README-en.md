## My experience with this project

It's my first app using react-native. I was so curious abbout this technology and I decided to search mora about it and make a project üßê. 
I had some difficulties to use the emulator from android studio, so I had to use my cellphone and I've stilled have some difficulties to use but I solved it üòë. I already have some reactJs experience so I didn't have difficulties to make this app, but, logicaly, I had to adaptade with somethings.
